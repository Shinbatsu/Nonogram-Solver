### What's Nonogram?

Nonograms, also known as Picross, Griddlers, or Japanese crosswords, are logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers given at the side of the grid. These numbers indicate how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. When completed correctly, the puzzle reveals a hidden picture.

Example:
For instance, a clue 3 1 for a row means:

```
There are 3 consecutive filled cells,
Followed by at least one blank cell,
Then 1 filled cell.
```


Nonograms require deductive reasoning and pattern recognition to solve and can vary in complexity from small 5Ã—5 grids to large, intricate puzzles.
